.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm keygen
.Op Ar nbits
.Nm pubout
.Nm encrypt key
.Nm decrypt key
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm genrsa
utility generates an RSA private key,
which essentially involves the generation of two prime numbers.
The generated private key, along with other information,
is written into the standard output and encoded into PEM + ASN.1 format,
containing the following data:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The version (hardcoded to
.Qq "0" ) .
.It
The composite modulus, N.
.It
The public value, e.
.It
The private value, d.
.It
The private value, d.
.It
The first prime factor of N, p.
.It
The second prime factor of N, p.
.It
The first exponent, d % (p - 1).
.It
The second exponent, d % (q - 1).
.It
The coefficient, q^-1 mod p.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Generate a 128-bit private key into
.Pa "key"
and extract the public key into
.Pa "key.pub" :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ genrsa 128 | tee key | pubout >key.pub
.Ed
.Pp
Check the structure of a 128-bit private key (requires OpenSSL):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ genrsa 128 | openssl asn1parse
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm genrsa ,
.Nm pubout ,
.Nm encrypt ,
.Nm decrypt
RSA
utilities are the product of a project for 2022 2nd semester's course
of Cyber Security of the Computer Science department
of the University of Brasilia, Brazil.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Ic "bignum.o"
module was written from scratch and is probably buggy;
i should have used an already existant arbitrary-precision arithmetic library.
.Pp
Generating keys can take long time,
especially for 256 bits or more.
